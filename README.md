# Numerical solver for Schrödinger's equation

Welcome ! I'm trying to build a solver for Schrödinger's equation.

## Goal
Build a numerical solver for Schrödinger's equation. Ideally, I would like it to handle time-dependent potential energies, but I would be happy if it only handles conservative systems.

## Philosophy
This is my first project of this magnitude, so I suppose that it won't be that optimized. I'll use NumPy and SciPy for calculations, as their methods will be more optimized than anything I could code.
